Thanks for using our chaotic little bot. Hereâ€™s how we handle your stuff:

## Data We Collect
- Message content (only to respond to you in a sassy/funny way)
- Server, user, and channel IDs (for logging and improving bot features)

## What We Donâ€™t Do
- We donâ€™t store personal data like passwords, emails, or DMs.
- We donâ€™t sell or share your info with third parties. Ever. Ew.

## Data Storage
- We only store whatâ€™s needed for basic bot functions.
- Logs (if any) are stored securely and auto-purged regularly.

## Your Control
- Want us to remove your data or stop being roasted? Just kick the bot or contact the dev.
